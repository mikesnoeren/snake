# Phaser Project Template

This repository serves as a starting point for developing applications using Phaser, a popular JavaScript framework for building games. The project is bundled using Vite, a modern front-end build tool that significantly improves the development experience.

In this template, you'll find a working version of the classic Snake game. Please note that some code may be opinionated, such as the UI being done in HTML instead of being done directly in Phaser. This approach allows for greater flexibility and customization, but feel free to adapt it to your preferred method.

## Prerequisites
- DDEV

## Getting Started

1) **Create a new repository from this template** \
   Click on the green "Use this template" button. This will create a new repository in your GitHub account with the same files and structure as this template.

2) **Start development** \
   Run `ddev start` in your local repository to start the development environment. This command will automatically install any dependencies, start a Vite dev server, and open your browser to the correct URL. The server will automatically reload the page when you make changes to the source code.

## Building the Project
To build the project for web deployment, run `npm run build`. This command compiles the project into static files for production. The output will be in the `./dist` directory, ready to be uploaded to any web server.

## Contributing
This project serves as my personal starting point for new projects, and I'm thrilled to share it with the community!

## Future Plans
As the development of this template progresses, several exciting updates and enhancements are on the horizon. Here's a glimpse into what's coming:

1. **Enhanced Snake Game Demo** \
   The Snake game demo will be expanded with new features and gameplay mechanics, including new levels and modes. This update aims to showcase the project structure for more advanced games, helping new developers understand how to build complex projects.

2. **Multiplayer Capabilities** \
   To add a social element to the game, multiplayer functionality will be integrated using socket.io. This will enable players to compete against each other in real-time, adding a competitive edge to the game.
